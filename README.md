# Guess The Number (web-game)
This is a simple website made for a school project.
The design is inspired by [this website](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/guess_number.html).

P.S.: don't blame me for the light theme, the dark one was the default (I'm no designer though).

## Gameplay
- The number is randomly chosen between 1 and 100.
- After each guess, a hint is shown.
- The game ends when the player guesses correctly.
- Achievements can be unlocked through the game, they are shown on the achievement page.

## Additional info
If you want to use the feedback form and send feedbacks you have to live-run the website.  
You can do it using [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VS Code.  

And don't forget to specify an email in the feedback-form:  
```<form action="https://formsubmit.co/YOUR_EMAIL_HERE" method="post">```
