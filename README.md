# Guess the number web-game
This is a simple website made for a school project.
The design is inspired by [this website](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/guess_number.html).

P.S: don't blame me for the light theme, the dark one was the default (I'm no designer though).

## Gameplay
- The number is randomly chosen between 1 and 100.
- After each guess, a hint is shown.
- The game ends when the player guesses correctly.
- Achievements can be unlocked through the game, they are shown on the achievement page.

## License
This project is free and can be used for personal or educational purposes.
